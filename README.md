A system for management of Library resources.
Assist in keeping records of lent and returned books.
Works hand in hand with library technichians.
Requires offline server to run. I currently use "xammp" for my apache and mysql servers.
Open the"new.php" file with your localhost, the rest should be self-explanatory.
